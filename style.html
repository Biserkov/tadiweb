<h1>Tadi web</h1>
<p>Welcome to the tadi web. A small and simple part of the normal web.</p>

<h2>Slippy mindset</h2>
<p>The tadi web is built with a slippy mindset. We try to be as 'slippy' as possible.</p>
<p><em>Being slippy means you're not stuck.</em></p>
<p>When you're slippy, it's easy to change plan, or rebuild something from scratch. It means you're not locked in to using a certain tool.</p>
<p>If something breaks, you can choose to fix it, or let it die. It's ok, because it won't take long to rebuild it from scratch.</p>

<blockquote>Frogs don't live forever! They live, they make some taddies, and then they die. The taddies grow to take their place.</blockquote>

<p>Every time you grow back, you'll be a bit different. You might be stronger. Or you might be better equipped for your changing needs.</p>

<h2>Tadi website</h2>

<p>There are many ways to make a tadi website. Here are some ideas for how you can do it.</p>
