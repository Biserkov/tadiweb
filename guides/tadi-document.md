# Tadi document

A tadi document is a special type of web document. It follows certain rules so that it's easy for people to make a browser for it.

You don't have to follow these rules to be a part of the tadi web. But they're a good guide of how to be *slippy*.

## File type

Tadi document files end in `.html`, which stands for "happy typing many lines".

## Structure

Every tadi document file has three sections.

* Document type
* Head
* Body

## Document type

Start your file with the **document type**.

```html
<!doctype html>
```

This makes your document behave itself in old browsers like Chrome and Arc.

## Head

The **head** contains info about your document, like the title.

```html
<head>
  <title>My website</title>
</head>
```

## Body

The **body** contains the content of your document.

```html
<body>
  <h1>My website</h1>
  <p>Welcome to my website.</p>
</body>
```

## Elements

You can add lots of different **elements** to your tadi document.

### Head elements
