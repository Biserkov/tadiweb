Welcome to the tadi web. A small and simple part of the normal web.

## Slippy mindset

The tadi web is built with a slippy mindset. We try to be as 'slippy' as possible.

*Being slippy means you're not stuck.*

When you're slippy, it's easy to change plan, or rebuild something from scratch. It means you're not locked in to using a certain tool.

If something breaks, you can choose to fix it, or let it die. It's ok, because it won't take long to rebuild it again from scratch.

> Frogs don't live forever! They live, they make some taddies, and then they die. The taddies grow to take their place.

Every time you grow back, you'll be a bit different. You might be stronger. Or you might be better equipped for your changing needs.
